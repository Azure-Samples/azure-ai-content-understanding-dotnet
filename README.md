#### Prerequisites

- **Docker**  
  Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (available for Windows, macOS, and Linux).  
  Docker is used to manage and run the container environment.  
  - Start Docker and ensure it is running in the background.

- **Visual Studio Code**  
  Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **Dev Containers Extension**  
  In the VS Code extension marketplace, install the extension named **Dev Containers**.  
  (This extension was previously called "Remote - Containers" but has since been renamed and integrated into **Dev Containers**.)

#### Steps

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-ai-content-understanding-dotnet.git
cd azure-ai-content-understanding-dotnet
```

2. Launch VS Code and open the folder:

```bash
code .
```

3. Press `F1`, then select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.

4. Wait for the setup to complete. Follow the instructions in [Configure Azure AI service resource](#configure-azure-ai-service-resource), then use the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code to run:

```bash
cd {ProjectName}
dotnet build
cd bin/Debug/net8.0/
dotnet {ProjectName}.dll
```

5. For an overview of the available projects in {ProjectName}, refer to the [Features](#features) section. We recommend starting with **ContentExtraction** as your first project.

---

### Option 2.2: Windows (using Visual Studio 2022 or later)

#### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK 8.0+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd)
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)

1. Clone the repo using Git or from Visual Studio:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-ai-content-understanding-dotnet
```

2. Open the `.sln` solution file in **[Visual Studio 2022+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)**.

3. Ensure the target framework is set to **.NET 8**.

4. Follow the instructions in [Configure Azure AI service resource](#configure-azure-ai-service-resource).

5. We recommend setting **ContentExtraction** as your Startup Project. For an overview of the available projects, refer to the [Features](#features) section.

6. Press **F5** or click **Start** to run the console app.

## <a name="configure-azure-ai-service-resource">Configure Azure AI Service Resource</a>

### (Option 1) Use `azd` commands to automatically create temporary resources to run the sample

1. Ensure you have permission to grant roles under your subscription.

2. Login to Azure:

```shell
azd auth login
```

If this does not work, try:

```shell
azd auth login --use-device-code
```

and follow the on-screen instructions.

3. Set up the environment, following prompts to choose the location:

```shell
azd up
```

---

### (Option 2) Manually create resources and set environment variables

1. Create an [Azure AI Services resource](docs/create_azure_ai_service.md).

2. In the Azure portal, navigate to `Access Control (IAM)` in your resource, and grant yourself the role **Cognitive Services User**.  
   - This step is required even if you are the owner of the resource.

3. Fill the **Endpoint** field in [appsettings.json](ContentUnderstanding.Common/appsettings.json) with the endpoint from your Azure AI Services instance in the Azure portal.

4. The **SubscriptionKey** field in [appsettings.json](ContentUnderstanding.Common/appsettings.json) is optional. It is only needed if you choose not to authenticate using `azd auth login` or `az login`, and instead prefer key-based authentication.

5. If using the recommended identity-based authentication, ensure you are signed in by running:

```shell
azd auth login
```

This ensures your Azure identity is properly authenticated for accessing secured resources.

## Features

Azure AI Content Understanding is a new Generative AI-based [Azure AI service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/overview), designed to process and ingest content of any type (documents, images, audio, and video) into a user-defined output format. Content Understanding offers a streamlined process to reason over large amounts of unstructured data, accelerating time-to-value by generating output that can be integrated into automation and analytical workflows.

| Project                     | Key Source File                   | Description |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| [ContentExtraction](ContentExtraction/) | [ContentExtractionService.cs](ContentExtraction/Services/ContentExtractionService.cs) | In this sample we will show content understanding API can help you get semantic information from your file. For example OCR with table in document, audio transcription, and face analysis in video. |
| [FieldExtraction](FieldExtraction/)   | [FieldExtractionService.cs](FieldExtraction/Services/FieldExtractionService.cs) | In this sample we will show how to create an analyzer to extract fields in your file. For example invoice amount in the document, how many people in an image, names mentioned in an audio, or summary of a video. You can customize the fields by creating your own analyzer template. |
| [FieldExtractionProMode](FieldExtractionProMode/)  |  [FieldExtractionService.cs](FieldExtractionProMode/Services/FieldExtractionProModeService.cs)  | In this sample we will demonstrate how to use **Pro mode** in Azure AI Content Understanding to enhance your analyzer with multiple inputs and optional reference data. Pro mode is designed for advanced use cases, particularly those requiring multi-step reasoning, and complex decision-making (for instance, identifying inconsistencies, drawing inferences, and making sophisticated decisions). |
| [Classifier](Classifier/) | [ClassifierService.cs](Classifier/Services/ClassifierService.cs) | This sample will demo how to (1) create a classifier to categorize documents, (2) create a custom analyzer to extract specific fields, and (3) combine classifier and analyzers to classify, optionally split, and analyze documents in a flexible processing pipeline. |
| [AnalyzerTraining](AnalyzerTraining/) | [AnalyzerTrainingService.cs](AnalyzerTraining/Services/AnalyzerTrainingService.cs) | If you want to futher boost the performance for field extraction, we can do training when you provide few labeled samples to the API. Note: This feature is available to document scenario now. |
| [Management](Management/)      | [ManagementService.cs](Management/Services/ManagementService.cs) | This sample will demo how to create a minimal analyzer, list all the analyzers in your resource, and delete the analyzer you don't need. |
| [BuildPersonDirectory](BuildPersonDirectory/)      | [BuildPersonDirectoryService.cs](BuildPersonDirectory/Services/BuildPersonDirectoryService.cs) | This sample will demo how to enroll peopleâ€™s faces from images and build a Person Directory. |
